These are some popular and user friendly OS integrations, providing things like system tray icons, file browser integration, etc. These are good starting points if you are a new user unfamiliar with Syncthing, or not prone to loving the command line.

- **[Syncthing Windows Setup](https://github.com/Bill-Stewart/SyncthingWindowsSetup/)**: a lightweight yet full-featured Windows installer

There’s a wealth of further integrations of all kinds listed on the [community contributions](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html) page.
